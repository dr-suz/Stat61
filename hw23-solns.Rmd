## Problem 1 

For $n=1040$ male college soccer players, the correlation between height and weight is about $r=0.75$. The sample means for heights and weights are about $\bar{x}=71$ in and $\bar{y}=166$ lbs, and the sample standard deviations are about $s_x=2.5$ in and $s_y = 16$ lbs.

(a) Find the least squares regression line for predicting weight from height. What proportion of the variability in weights is explained by a linear fit on height? 

In a SLR model, the estimate for the slope is $\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = r\frac{s_y}{s_x}$ and the estimate for the intercept is $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$. Recall that $s^2_x = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ and $r = \frac{1}{n-1}\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}$. Thus $\hat{\beta}_1 = (0.75)(16)/2.5 = 4.8$ inches/lb and $\hat{\beta}_0 = 166 - (4.8)(71) = -174.8$ inches. 

(b) Find the fitted weight for a 66 inch player and for a 76 inch player. Explain how these fitted values illustrate the regression towards the mean effect in an answer that involves standard deviations relative to the respective means. Hint: You textbook mentions "regression towards mediocrity" but if you google this phrase, you'll find lots of examples and wiki pages on this phenomena! 

```{r}
-174.89 + 4.8*66
-174.89 + 4.8*76
```

(c) Use the sample correlation and standard deviation of the weights to find the root mean squared error for the simple regression model. Explain what this number represents in this context.

## Problem 2 

Consider the no-intercept linear regression model 
$$Y_i \mid X_i=x_i \sim N(\beta x_i, \sigma^2), \quad i=1, \dots, n.$$
We should include an intercept in the model even if we believe the mean response when $x=0$ should be 0, however working with the no-intercept model can help understand the more complicated model since here $\beta$ is a scalar rather than a vector. 

(a) Show that the least squares estimate for $\beta$ is $\hat\beta = \frac{\sum_{i}x_i Y_i}{\sum_i x_i^2} = (\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \times 1$ matrix (vector) of $x_i$ values and $\mathbf{Y}$ is the $n \times 1$ vector of $Y_i$ values. 

The least squares estimate for $\beta$ solves $\min \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ with respect to $\beta$. To find this minimizer, we consider
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \sum (y_i - \beta x_i)^2 = \sum 2 (y_i - \beta x_i)(-x_i) \stackrel{set}{=} 0$$
which solving for $\beta$ produces the least squares estimate
$$\hat{\beta}_{LSE} = \sum{y_i x_i}{\sum x_i^2}$$ 
since we can verify this is a minimum by checking
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} 2\sum (-x_i)(y_i - \beta x_i) = 2 \sum (-x_i)^2 > 0.$$


(b) Write the joint log-likelihood of $(\beta, \sigma^2)$ and explain why the MLE for $\beta$ is the same as the least squares estimate for $\beta$. 

$$Lik(\beta, \sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(y_i; \beta, \sigma)  =  \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(y_i - \beta x_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}} =\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}\right)^n \left(\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)^n \exp\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \beta x_i)^2 \}$$
Now we find thee MLE for $\beta$ by setting the first derivative of the (log) likelihood equal to zero and solving for $\hat{\beta}$:
\begin{align*}
\ln Lik (\beta, \sigma) = const + n(0-\ln(\sigma)) - \frac{\sum (y_i - \beta x_i)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \\
\hspace{3 cm} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \ln Lik(\beta, \sigma) = \frac{\sum x_i(y_i - \beta x_i)^2}{\sigma^2} \stackrel{set}{=} 0 \text{ and thus } \hat{\beta}_{MLE} = \frac{\sum{y_i x_i}}{\sum x_i^2} = \hat{\beta}_{LSE}
\end{align*}

(c) Find the mean and variance of $\hat \beta$. 

$$E\left( \hat{\beta}\right) = E \left(\frac{\sum x_i Y_i}{\sum x_i^2} \right) = \frac{\sum x_i E(Y_i)}{\sum x_i^2} = \frac{\sum x_i (\beta x_i)}{\sum x_i^2} = \frac{\beta \sum x_i^2}{\sum x_i^2} = \beta$$
and 
\begin{align*}
Var(\hat{\beta}) &= Var\left(\frac{\sum x_i Y_i}{\sum x_i^2} \right)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{\sum x_i^2}\right)^2 Var \left(\sum x_i Y_i \right)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{\sum x_i^2}\right)^2 \sum_i \sum_j x_i x_j Cov(Y_i, Y_j)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{\sum x_i^2}\right)^2  \sum_i \sum_j x_i x_j Cov(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{\sum x_i^2}\right)^2  \sum_i \sum_{j=i} x_i x_j Cov(\epsilon_i, \epsilon_j)\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{\sum x_i^2}\right)^2  \sum_{i=1}^n x_i  x_i Var(\epsilon_j)\\
&= \left(\frac{\sum x_i^2}{(\sum x_i^2)^2}\right) \sigma^2 \\
&= \frac{\sigma}{\sum x_i^2}
\end{align*}

Also, recall from our class notes that we expect $Var(Y) = \sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1}$ and here, $X^T = \begin{pmatrix}x_1 x_2 \dots x_n \end{pmatrix}$ so $X^T X = \sum x_i ^2$.

## Problem 3
A simple exponential decay models says that the concentration, $C_{(t)}$ of a pesticide remaining after time $t$ is $C_{(t)} = C_0 e^{-\gamma t}$ for $t>0$ where $C_0$ is the initial concentration and $\gamma$ is a constant that determines the rate of decay. 

(a) Show how taking the natural log of both sides of the equation above results in a linear model for $Y = \log (C_{(t)})$ on $t$. What are the slope and intercept? 

$$\ln \left( C_{(t)} \right)  = \ln \left(C_0 e^{-\gamma t} \right) = ln(C_0) - \gamma t$$
is the equation for a line where the intercept is $ln(C_0)$ and the slope is $-\gamma$. 

(b) If you have data on concentrations at $n$ different times, $t_i$, you could estimate $\gamma$ by fitting a SLR of $Y_i$ on $t_i$. This implicitly assumes an additive error term $\epsilon_i$ that is approximately normally distributed. Write out the implied model for $C_{(t)}$ and describe how error enters this model. 

If we observe $t_i$ for $i=1, \dots, n$, and regress these observations on $Y = \ln C_{(t)}$ then we are implying the model for $Y$ is:
$$ Y_i = \ln \left(C_0 e^{-\gamma t} \right) = ln(C_0) - \gamma t_i + \epsilon_i, \quad \text{where } \epsilon_i \stackrel{IID}{\sim}Normal.$$
That is, $C_{(t_i)} = C_0 e^{-\gamma t_i} e^{\epsilon_i}\quad \text{where } \epsilon_i \stackrel{IID}{\sim}Normal.$ Hence the error enters this model as a multiplicative factor, rather than an additive one.
